To host your HTML file along with its associated CSS file on GitHub Pages, you need to follow these steps:
    Create a GitHub Repository:
        If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub.
        Name it appropriately, such as "HaierFan_IR_Remote".

    Upload Your Files:
        Upload your index.html, script.js and style.css files to this repository. You can do this directly through the GitHub website or using Git commands locally.

    Enable GitHub Pages:
        Go to your repository's settings tab.
        Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
        Choose the branch where your HTML file resides. Typically, you'd choose the main branch.
        Set the folder to / or /docs if you have your files in a folder.
        Save your settings.

    Access Your Site:
        After saving the settings, GitHub will provide you with a URL where your site is hosted. It usually follows this format: 
        ```
        https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>
        ```
        In your case, it will be something like 
        ```https://<username>.github.io/HaierFan_IR_Remote```

    Optional: Custom Domain (if needed):
        If you have a custom domain, you can configure it to point to your GitHub Pages site by following the instructions in the GitHub Pages settings.
